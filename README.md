Project Description
This project is a full-screen escape challenge game built with Tkinter, where players solve two math problems and click the exact coordinate matching their answers before time runs out. 
It combines problem-solving, mouse precision, and a countdown timer to create an engaging, high-pressure puzzle.
The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Tests your super duper important 8th grade math during important work.

The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We made a math problem.That's it.Yep.
